The rapid climate change and increasing obesity rates are two significant concerns for policy makers around the world. We aim to determine if climate change, in particular increasing CO2 emissions, be a driver for the global obesity rates. At first it might seem like CO2 and obesity rates are completely unrelated. However, on analyzing trends including the countries' GDP per capita and the meat consumption/production frequencies, we were able to understand why there is an underlying relationship.


## Data Analysis and Methodology 
For the purpose of this project, 3 primary data sets were used; global CO2 emissions, prevalence of obesity among adults and the GDP per capita, with all values categorized based on countries. For purposes of data cleaning, processing and plotting, we decided to use R as a programming language since it was common in the team-members' skill-set.



## Conclusion
Based on our findings, there was a clear positive relationship between the GDP per capita, global CO2 emissions and the obesity rates throughout all countries. Although we cannot establish a clear causative relationship between the two, we were able to identify possible factors that played a role. 

A possible driving factor is the worldwide meat consumption. Although it would be hard for us to quantify the proportion of greenhouse gases being a result of meat consumption, we referred to a report published by University of California. According to it, the current meat production and consumption patterns account for 15-24% of the greenhouse emissions.


## Improvements
Overall, this was a very enjoyable project and I believe it contributed to our learning A LOT! There were a bunch of things we were proud with our performance in! There were also a couple instances where we could have made improvements in.
