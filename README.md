The rapid climate change and increasing obesity rates are two significant concerns for policy makers around the world. We aim to determine if climate change, in particular increasing CO2 emissions, be a driver for the global obesity rates.

## Conclusion
Based on our findings, there was a clear positive relationship between the global CO2 emissions and the obesity rates. Althought we cannot establish a clear causative relationship between the two, we were able to identify possible factors that played a role. 

A possible driving factor is the worldwide meat consumption. Although it would be hard for us to quantify the proportion of greenhouse gases being a result of meat consumption, we referred to a report published by University of California. According to it, the current meat production and consumption patterns account for 15-24% of the greenhouse emissions.


## Improvements
Overall, this was a very enjoyable project and I believe it contributed to our learning A LOT! There were a bunch of things we were proud with our performance in! There were also a couple instances where we could have made improvements in.
