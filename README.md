The rapid climate change and inscreasing obesity rates are two significant concerns for policy makers around the world. We aim to determine if climate change, in particular increasing CO2 emissions, be a driver for the global obesity rates.

## Conclusion
Based on our findings, there was a clear positive relationship between the global CO2 emissions and the obesity rates. A possible driving factor is the worldwide meat consumption. Although it would be hard for us to quantify the proportion of greenhouse gases being a result of meat consumption, we referred to a report published by University of California. According to it, the current meat production and consumption patterns account for 15-24% of the greenhouse emissions.
